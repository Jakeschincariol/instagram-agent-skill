"""
detect.py - a five-check panel that scores how machine-written a draft looks.

What this is:  five local heuristics modelled on the signals public AI
detectors actually measure - sentence-length variation, concreteness, stock
vocabulary, typographic fingerprint, and voice. Every score is computed on
your machine from the text alone. Nothing is uploaded.

What this is NOT:  GPTZero, Originality, Copyleaks, Winston or Turnitin.
It does not call their APIs and it cannot promise their verdict. It catches
the things they all key on, which is why fixing them tends to move their
numbers too - but the only honest claim is the one on this line.

Each check returns a HUMAN score from 0 to 100. Higher is better. A check the
text is too short to measure (BURSTINESS under 4 sentences, SPECIFICITY under
25 words) is reported as n/a and left out of the verdict; VOICE on a short text
is judged on structural tells alone.
